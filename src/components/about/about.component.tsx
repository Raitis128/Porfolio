      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Raitis Ižiks, and I am a 23&nbsp;year&nbsp;old from
        Latvia with a deep passion for technology. From an early age, I have
        been fascinated by computers, which has driven my lifelong interest in
        the field. I hold a Professional Bachelor’s Degree in Information
        Technologies from Daugavpils University, where I built a strong
        foundation in algorithms, data structures, software engineering
        principles, and communication skills.
